__AAAA CANADIAN CRAFT CANNABIS__

__Purple God__ (Hybrid I:70/S:30)  God Bud x Hawaiian Skunk x Purple Skunk                                   For many patients, she is a “one hitter quitter”, a strong, indica-dominant hybrid.  Just like her effects, she smells and tastes strong, with pungent, skunky notes of soil and earth. She is especially great for evening use or right before bed as a nightcap.
