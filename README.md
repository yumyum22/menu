__AAAA CANADIAN CRAFT CANNABIS__

__Purple God__ (Hybrid I:50/S:50)  _God Bud x Hawaiian Skunk x Purple Skunk_                                                                
For many patients, she is a “one hitter quitter”, a strong, indica-dominant hybrid.  Just like her effects, she smells and tastes strong, with pungent, skunky notes of soil and earth. She is especially great for evening use or right before bed as a nightcap.

__Cake Crasher__ (Hybrid I:90/S:10)  _Wedding Cake x Wedding Crasher_                                      
This delectable treat is rich with tangy sweet earth and pepper, many often note a hint of vanilla with sweet grape undertones.  Enjoy this double dose of dense dankness with care, as certain farms have noted THC content upwards of 25% or greater. Overall a mellow, earthy strain with sharp gassy highlights and a sweet berry finish.

__Apricot Ice Cream__ (Indica) _Legend Orange Apricot x Ice Cream Man_
She smells of berries and apricots with a hint of fresh oranges mixed with a little spice. The smoke has added notes of skunk, producing an energetic and euphoric high that hits quickly, expect an overall happy experience with this strain.
