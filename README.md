__AAAA CANADIAN CRAFT CANNABIS__

__Forum Cut - Girl Scout Cookies (GSC)__ (Hybrid I:60/S:40) OG Kush x Durban Poison
A hybrid cross whose reputation grew too large to stay within the borders of its California homeland. With a sweet and earthy aroma, GSC launches you to euphoriaâ€™s top floor where full-body relaxation meets a time-bending cerebral space. A little goes a long way with this hybrid, whose THC heights have won GSC numerous Cannabis Cup awards. Patients needing a strong dose of relief, however, may look to GSC for severe pain, nausea, and appetite loss
